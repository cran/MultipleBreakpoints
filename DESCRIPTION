        of Bernoulli Variables
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Nicolas Froelich
Maintainer: Nicolas Froelich <nicfroe@posteo.de>
Description: The iterative procedure estimates structural changes in the success probability of Bernoulli variables. It estimates the number and location of the breakpoints as well as the success probability of the different sequences between the breakpoints. In addition, it provides a graphical illustration of the result.
